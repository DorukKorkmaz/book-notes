## The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development

by Chad Fowler

### Introduction

* According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American spends half their waking time at work.
* If your life is primarily consumed by your work, then loving your work is one of the most important keys to loving your life.
* Once we have basic human needs like food and shelter taken care of, most of our goals are geared toward finding happiness.

#### Failure Is Off The Radar!

* A person who wants to be great is far more likely to become great than someone who just wants to do their job.

#### You Own It

* To excel at a company, you have to understand how you fit into the business's plan to make money.
* Your company is investing in you. Your challenge is to become an obviously good investment, and to judge your own performance in terms of the value you bring to the business.

### Part 1: Choosing Your Market

* Many of us just float down the stream of our careers, letting the current take us where it may.
* If you think of your career as a business (which it is), then your "product" is made up of the services you have to offer.

#### Tip 1: Lead or Bleed?

* The risk-reward trade-off is an important part of making intentional choices about which technologies and domains to invest in.
* Picking a stable technology that's already widely used in production is safer, but potentially less rewarding, than picking a flashy new technology not yet deployed.
* Old systems don't just die, but are replaced. As a *technology hospice*, you are the last one left to support still-critical systems, and can pretty much call the shots.

#### Tip 2: Supply and Demand

* The supply-and-demand model predicts how price changes will affect the number of people willing to sell and purchase a product or service.
* Offshore companies do work that is in high demand. So by focusing on niche technologies, you might change the focus of the competition from price (which you cannot compete on) to ability.
* The lower price of offshore programmers drives down the overall price, thereby increasing overall demand – including a higher bracket of developers.
* The most important lesson from the supply and demand model is that with increased demand comes increased price competition.

#### Tip 3: Coding Don't Cut It Anymore

* If you want to stay relevant, you must dive into the domain of the business you're in.
* You might be "just a programmer," but being able to speak to your business clients in the language of their business domain is a critical skill.
* Business domains can become hot, just like technologies. Put the same care into selecting which industry to serve as you put into which technologies to master.
* Find industry web sites you can monitor, and think about how current trends affect your company, your division, your team, and your work.

#### Tip 4: Be the Worst

* Being the worst guy in the band means always playing with people who are better than you.
* Similarly, being the worst guy or gal on the team has the same effect as being the worst guy or gal in the band. You find that you inexplicably get smarter.

#### Tip 5: Invest in Your Intelligence

* Good people seek out diversity, either because they love to learn new things, or being forced into alien experiences creates more mature and well-rounded software developers.
* Exposure to fringe technologies makes you deeper, better, smarter, and more creative.

#### Tip 6: Don't Listen to Your Parents

* Your parents will give you fear-driven advice that optimizes for *not losing*. But winners take risks.
* If your job isn't fun, then you won't do a fantastic job at it. Because passion leads to excellence, and without fun there won't be passion.
* The more domains you've seen and technical architectures you've slogged through, the more prepared you are to make the right decisions on tougher projects.
* Take calculated risks in your career, and don't let fear consume you.

#### Tip 7: Be a Generalist

* Things change in a business, and businesspeople know that software is malleable and can be changed to meet changing requirements.
* In such a rapidly changing environment, flexible people that can solve any problem that arises will excel.
* If the programmers don't understand what a system is supposed to do, then they won't be able to create a good implementation of it – regardless of any requirements, architecture, or design documents.
* If you want to be the last person standing after layoffs, then you had better make yourself generally useful.
* If you want to stand out and be remarkable, then wrapping your head around The Big Picture is where it's at.
* When it comes to hierarchical boundary crossing, it's most often not reluctance that stops people from doing it – it's ability.
* Longevity requires that you are platform neutral in the workplace. We all have our preferences, but leave your ideals at home.

#### Tip 8: Be a Specialist

* The software industry has churned out a lot of shallow specialists, who use the term *specialist* as an excuse for only knowing one thing.
* Strive to be a specialist with a deep understanding of some specific area in the software field.

#### Tip 9: Don't Put All Your Eggs in Someone Else's Basket

* We fool ourselves into thinking *market leader* is the same thing as *standard*. This helps us rationalize making another company's product part of our identity.
* You can build a business that exists as a parasite of another, but it's risky for an individual. You don't have the bandwidth or surplus of cash to suddenly change career direction or focus like a company would.
* The *professional services barrier* is the artificial barrier that a company erects between you and the solution to a problem you may have so that it can profit from selling you support services.

#### Tip 10: Love It or Leave It

* You have to be passionate about your work if you want to be great at your work. If you don't care, it will show.
* Many people have no idea why they are in the IT field, and their performance on the job reflects it.
* Natural talent plays a big role in ability, but we can all take a big step away from mediocrity by finding work that we are passionate about.
* You can fake it for a while, but a lack of passion will catch up with you and your work.
