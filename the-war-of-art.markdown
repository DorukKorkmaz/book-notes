## The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles

by Steven Pressfield

### The Unlived Life

* Most of us have two lives: The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.
* To yield to Resistance deforms our spirit. It stunts us and makes us less than we are and were born to be.

### Book One: Resistance

#### Resistance's Greatest Hits

* Any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity elicits Resistance.

#### Resistance is Invisible

* Resistance is only felt – as a repelling force, shoving us away, distracting us, preventing us from doing our work.

#### Resistance is Internal

* Resistance arises from within. It is self-generated and self-perpetuated. It does not come from outside ourselves.

#### Resistance is Implacable

* Resistance is an engine of destruction, programmed with only one objective: To prevent us from doing our work.

#### Resistance is Infallible

* The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.

#### Resistance is Universal

* Everyone who has a body experiences Resistance.

#### Resistance Never Sleeps

* The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day.

#### Resistance Plays for Keeps

* Resistance targets our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on earth to give and that no one else has but us.

#### Resistance is Fueled by Fear

* Resistance has no strength of its own. Instead we feed it with power by our fear of it.

#### Resistance Only Opposes in One Direction

* Resistance obstructs movement only from a lower sphere to a higher one.

#### Resistance is Most Powerful at the Finish Line

* The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight. It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it's got.

#### Resistance Recruits Allies

* Overcoming resistance encourages sabotage by others. They struggle with their own resistance, and the awakening writer's success becomes a reproach to them.
* The best and only thing that one artist can do for another is to serve as an example and an inspiration.

#### Resistance and Procrastination

* Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance because it's the easiest to rationalize.

#### Resistance and Procrastination, Part Two

* The most pernicious aspect of procrastination is that it can become habit, and we put off our lives until our deathbed.
* There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny.

#### Resistance and Sex

* Sex provides immediate and powerful gratification. Resistance has distracted us from doing our work with a cheap, easy fix.
* The more empty you feel, the more certain you can be that your true motivation for sex was not love or even lust but resistance.

#### Resistance and Trouble

* Trouble is a faux form of fame, and we get into trouble because it's a cheap way to get attention.
* The working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows trouble prevents her from doing her work.

#### Resistance and Self-Dramatization

* When we drug ourselves to blot out our soul's call, we are being good Americans and exemplary consumers.
* Instead of consuming a product, we should apply self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification, and hard work.

#### Resistance and Victimhood

* A victim act is a form of passive aggression, seeking to achieve gratification not by honest work, but by the manipulation of others through silent or not-so-silent threat.

#### Resistance and the Choice of a Mate

* Picking someone who has or is successfully overcoming Resistance is how Resistance disfigures love.
* The supporting partner should face the failure to pursue his unlived life, and not merely ride the other's coattails.
* The supported partner should step out from the glow of her partner's adoration, and instead encourage him to let his own light shine.

#### Resistance and Unhappiness

* Resistance creates intense unhappiness, and we live in a consumer culture that has massed all its profit-seeking artillery to exploit it.
* Our obligation is to enact an internal revolution, where in this uprising we free ourselves from the tyranny of consumer culture.

#### Resistance and Fundamentalism

* Answering "Who am I?" and "Why am I here?" is not easy because we are wired tribally, to act as part of a group, and not as an individual.
* The artist has a faith that humankind is advancing, however haltingly and imperfectly, toward a better world.
* The fundamentalist, by contrast, sees humanity as fallen from a higher state. It is the philosophy of the powerless, the conquered, the displaced and the dispossessed.
* The fundamentalist cannot find his way to the future, so he retreats to the past, returning in imagination to the glory days.
* Fundamentalism and art are mutually exclusive. The creativity for a fundamentalist is inverted, for he creates destruction.
* Socrates observed that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.

#### Resistance and Criticism

* When we see others beginning to live their authentic selves, it drives us crazy if we have not lived out our own.
* Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others.

#### Resistance and Self-Doubt

* Self-doubt can be an ally because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love of something you dream of doing, and desire to do it.
* The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.

#### Resistance and Fear

* Fear tell us what we have to do: The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.
* The professional tackles the project that will make him stretch, that will compel him to explore unconscious parts of himself.
* The professional turns down roles that he's done before – he's not afraid of them anymore, so why waste his time?

#### Resistance and Love

* If you didn't love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn't feel anything. The opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference.

#### Resistance and Being a Star

* Grandiose fantasies are the sign of an amateur. A professional knows that success, like happiness, is a by-product of work.
* The professional concentrates on the work and allows rewards to come or not come, whatever they like.
