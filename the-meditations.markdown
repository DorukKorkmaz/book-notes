## The Meditations: An Emperor's Guide to Mastery

by Marcus Aurelius

(a new rendering by Sam Torode)

### Foreword

* Stoicism doesn't mean repressing emotion and shunning pleasure, but focusing on what is in our power and letting go of everything we can't control.

### Book 1

* Busyness is no excuse for neglecting our duties to family, friends, and community.

### Book 2

* No one can hurt you but yourself, for no one else can make you forsake the good and embrace the bad.
* Don't worry about what others think. Mind what _you_ think. Watch the movements of your mind, and focus your thoughts on something worthy.
* Few things are worse than nosy people who try to conjecture what's in their neighbors' minds, instead of tending to their own.
* When we die, we don't "lose" the past or future – we never owned them.
* When you do anything insincere, halfhearted, or thoughtless, you harm yourself. Even the smallest action should be performed with a goal in mind.

### Book 3

* Direct your thoughts to a useful end. When you dissipate your mental energy on things you can't control, you lose the opportunity to accomplish something yourself.
* Be a person of few words and a few projects, not busy and scattered.
* Remember that you live in the present moment – a single, indivisible point in time. The past is gone and the future is unknowable. Brief is the moment in which you live; small is the plot of earth beneath your feet.
* With each person you meet, remind yourself that you share a common humanity. You belong to the same family.
* Expect nothing, fear nothing, speak truly, and act heroically. Nothing can stop you.
* Be content in your circumstances; preserve the spark of divinity within; follow the light of reason; live simply and serenely; and be happy with your lot in life, and ready to depart when you're called.

### Book 4

* It's within your power to find solace at any time, by retreating into yourself. When your thoughts are orderly and tranquil, there's no place more peaceful than your own soul.
* Nothing touches the soul; it can't be harmed by anything external. When you are upset, it is your own opinion that upsets you.
* To change your experience, change your opinion. Stop telling yourself that you're a victim and the pain goes away.
* Think in accordance with reason. If your opinions cause you distress, change your opinions.
* In the race of life, stay in your lane and focus on the finish line; don't gawk a the missteps of others.
* Much of what we do is unnecessary, unfocused, and unhelpful. How much time can you gain by pruning these activities?
* Focus on what's important. Give great attention to great matters, and little attention to little matters.
* Difficult circumstances can befall anyone – what's telling is how a person responds to their circumstances.
* Life is not disjointed but logical. Everything that happens is the consequence of what came before.
* You are free if you are neither crushed by the present or afraid of the future. Storms befall everyone; but not everyone can stand firm against them.
