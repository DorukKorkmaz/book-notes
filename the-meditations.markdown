## The Meditations: An Emperor's Guide to Mastery

by Marcus Aurelius

(a new rendering by Sam Torode)

### Foreword

* Stoicism doesn't mean repressing emotion and shunning pleasure, but focusing on what is in our power and letting go of everything we can't control.

### Book 1

* Busyness is no excuse for neglecting our duties to family, friends, and community.

### Book 2

* No one can hurt you but yourself, for no one else can make you forsake the good and embrace the bad.
* Don't worry about what others think. Mind what _you_ think. Watch the movements of your mind, and focus your thoughts on something worthy.
* Few things are worse than nosy people who try to conjecture what's in their neighbors' minds, instead of tending to their own.
* When we die, we don't "lose" the past or future – we never owned them.
* When you do anything insincere, halfhearted, or thoughtless, you harm yourself. Even the smallest action should be performed with a goal in mind.

### Book 3

* Direct your thoughts to a useful end. When you dissipate your mental energy on things you can't control, you lose the opportunity to accomplish something yourself.
* Be a person of few words and a few projects, not busy and scattered.
* Remember that you live in the present moment – a single, indivisible point in time. The past is gone and the future is unknowable. Brief is the moment in which you live; small is the plot of earth beneath your feet.
* With each person you meet, remind yourself that you share a common humanity. You belong to the same family.
* Expect nothing, fear nothing, speak truly, and act heroically. Nothing can stop you.
* Be content in your circumstances; preserve the spark of divinity within; follow the light of reason; live simply and serenely; and be happy with your lot in life, and ready to depart when you're called.

### Book 4

* It's within your power to find solace at any time, by retreating into yourself. When your thoughts are orderly and tranquil, there's no place more peaceful than your own soul.
* Nothing touches the soul; it can't be harmed by anything external. When you are upset, it is your own opinion that upsets you.
* To change your experience, change your opinion. Stop telling yourself that you're a victim and the pain goes away.
* Think in accordance with reason. If your opinions cause you distress, change your opinions.
* In the race of life, stay in your lane and focus on the finish line; don't gawk a the missteps of others.
* Much of what we do is unnecessary, unfocused, and unhelpful. How much time can you gain by pruning these activities?
* Focus on what's important. Give great attention to great matters, and little attention to little matters.
* Difficult circumstances can befall anyone – what's telling is how a person responds to their circumstances.
* Life is not disjointed but logical. Everything that happens is the consequence of what came before.
* You are free if you are neither crushed by the present or afraid of the future. Storms befall everyone; but not everyone can stand firm against them.

### Book 5

* You cannot be unhappy when you have another opportunity to do what you were born to do.
* If you truly love yourself, love your nature and vocation. Those who love their work don't even think of stopping.
* You can develop greater sincerity, generosity, persistence, strength, and contentment in all circumstances.
* It's better to be honest and straightforward than mere witty and clever.
* Fate prescribes events, but it is up to you accept and act upon that prescription.
* It is always within your power to think and act in harmony with your own nature, and with the nature of the universe.
* Don't pin your happiness on anything that isn't part of your rightful inheritance as a human being.
* No matter what comes your way, you can find someone who has gone through the same experience and stood strong, emerging spiritually unharmed.
* Other people may try to impede your actions, but they can't impede your thoughts and disposition.
* When you come upon a stumbling block, use it as a stepping stone.
* Instead of boasting or moaning, rest content knowing that you are a small part of the universe, and treasure the moment in eternity you have been given.
* If someone does you wrong, that's their problem – it harms their character, not yours. Focus on your own thoughts and actions.
* Anger does you no good. And so it is no use to be angry.
* Nothing short of death can prevent you from thinking, feeling, and acting as you choose.

### Book 6

* Taking an insult or injury and transforming it into a means of becoming a better person is the only true vengeance.
* To not be fooled into treasuring pretty things, take praised or prise things and strip them of the words by which they're exalted.
* All things find fulfillment in actualizing their nature. Pinning your happiness on anything else makes you a slave to desire.
* When you don't have what you want, you're jealous of those who have it; when you have what you want, you're suspicious of those who might take it away.
* In every arena, give your best effort, respect the competition, and whatever the outcome, walk away in peace.
* Seek the truth – the truth never hurt anyone. Continuing in error is what causes injury.
* When something scares you, it is your beliefs that scare you. Release your beliefs and the fear dissolves.
* Exert your efforts within your sphere of power, and be indifferent to everything else.
* List the good qualities of people you know – nothing delights us like virtue embodied in a particular person.
* Use persuasion and be peaceful and patient when others block your path. Whether or not you reach your goal, you'll gain a deeper and stronger character.
* When others speak, imagine yourself in their shoes and see things from their perspective.
* Things themselves don't have the power to determine our opinions about them – we form opinions.

### Book 7

* Why entertain worries and fears when your thoughts, opinions, and interpretations are all in your power to choose?
* Don't be too proud to ask for help – people are social beings who need each other.
* Don't worry about the future – by doing your best today, you'll build the strength and resources to handle whatever tomorrow brings.
* You are not injured by anything unless you view the event as a terrible, unfair, unfortunate event inflicted upon you.
* Nothing would ever happen without change. It is the nature of the universe, so embrace it.
* When someone wrongs you, identify the mistaken ideas that motivated their behavior. 
* Be grateful for the things you do have, and imagine how desirable they would seem if you didn't already have them.
* Those who strive for fame are competing to build the largest pile of sand; tomorrow, the wind comes and blows it all away.
* Up close, we see the chaos of animals and soldiers; from far away, we see the orderliness of herds and armies.
* It is always within your power to accept your present circumstances, be kind to those around you, and to cultivate true and useful thoughts.
* When "misfortune" befalls you, think of others who have experienced the same thing. Can you turn this obstacle into a stepping stone?
* Don't treat inhumane people the way they treat others, lest you become inhumane.
* It is ridiculous to despite others for their faults and failings, while indulging and excusing your own.
