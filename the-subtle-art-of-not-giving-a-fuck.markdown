## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck

by Mark Manson

### Chapter 1: Don't Try

* Conventional life advice, or all the positive stuff and happy self-help stuff we hear all the time, fixates on what you lack.
* If you're dreaming of something all the time, then you're reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over: that you are _not that_.

#### The Feedback Loop from Hell

* Consumer culture and social media has bred a whole generation who believe that having negative experiences like anxiety, fear, guilt, etc is not okay.
* The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience, while the accepting of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.
* Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience, so don't try to escape it.
* You must learn how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively, or how to pick and choose what matters to you and what doesn't based on finely honed personal values.

#### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck

* Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck doesn't mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
  * Indifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices, which is why they don't make any meaningful choices.
  * You must say "fuck it" not to everything in life, but rather to everything unimportant in life. Save your fucks for what truly matters.
* Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
  * If you don't find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes.
* Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.
  * Maturity is what happens when we learn to give fucks about only what's truly fuckworthy.

#### So Mark, What the Fuck Is the Point of This Book Anyway?

* Practical enlightenment is becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is inevitable, and that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, and even death.
* The only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it.

### Chapter 2: Happiness Is a Problem

* Pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them.
* Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature, and necessary components to creating constant happiness.

#### The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda

* We suffer because it is biologically useful: It is nature's preferred agent for inspiring change.
* A constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering.
* A society that coddles itself more and more from the discomforts of life is dangerous: We lose the benefits of experiencing healthy doses of pain, which disconnects us from the reality of the world around us.

#### Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

* True happiness occurs when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.
* Instead of solving, people either a) deny they exist in the first place, or b) choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems, even when there is.
* Forms of blame and denial allow us to temporarily escape our problems, and that escape can provide us a quick rush to feel better.

#### Emotions are Overrated

* Negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it's because you're supposed to _do something_.
* To deny one's negative emotions is to deny many of the feedback mechanisms that help a person solve problems.

#### Choose Your Struggle

* An interesting question that most people will never consider is "What _pain_ do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?" 
* Real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles.
* What determines your success isn't "What do you want to enjoy?" but "What pain do you want to sustain?" Our struggles determine our success.

### Chapter 3: You Are Not Special

* A true and accurate measurement of one's self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself.
* Entitled people have a delusional degree of self-confidence.
* Because entitled people are incapable of acknowledging their problems openly and honestly, they are incapable of improving their lives in any lasting or meaningful way.

#### Things Fall Apart

* If we have problems that are unsolvable, our unconscious figures that we're uniquely special or uniquely defective in some way. Put simply: we become entitled.
* Entitled people flip between being on top of the world or having the world on top of them, demanding special treatment in each case.
* It takes just as much energy and delusional self-aggrandizement to maintain the belief that one has insurmountable problems as that one has no problems at all.
* In an age when we're more connected than ever, entitlement seems to be at an all-time high.

#### The Tyranny of Exceptionalism

* Our lives today are filled with information from the extremes of the bell curve of human experience, because in the media business that what sells.
* This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal. Because we are mostly average, this drives us to feel insecure and desperate.

#### B-b-b-but If I'm Not Going to Be Special or Extraordinary, What's the Point?

* When a culture's standard of success is "be extraordinary," it's better to be at the low end of the bell curve than in the middle, because there you're still special and deserve attention.
* People who become great at something become great because they understand that they're only mediocre, and that they could be so much better. It's anti-entitlement.
