## Remote: Office Not Required

by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson

### Chapter 1: The Time is Right for Remote Work

#### Why work doesn't happen at work

* The ability to be alone with your thoughts is one of the key advantages of working remotely.
* Working outside the office introduces interruptions, but they are things you can control. They're passive. They don't handcuff you.

#### Stop commuting your life away

* Research shows commuting is associated with increased risk of obesity, insomnia, stress, neck and back pain, high blood pressure, heart attacks and depression, and even divorce.

#### It's the technology, stupid

* Progressive companies have not been practicing working remotely because for a long time, the technology just wasn't there.

#### Escaping 9am - 5pm

* Once you've structured your work technique and expectations to deal with coworkers in other time zones, those benefits extend to those in the same time zone, or even the same city.
* Having flexible hours is especially important for creative work, where you can't force yourself into the zone.

#### End of city monopoly

* The luxury privilege of the next twenty years will be to leave the city – not to the suburbs, but to wherever one wants.

#### The new luxury

* The new luxury is to shed the shackles of deferred living – to pursue your passions now, while still working.
* Instead of bifurcating your life into work and retirement, you can blend the two to design a better lifestyle that makes work enjoyable because it's not the only thing on the menu.

#### Talent isn't bound by the hubs

* When you have so many competitors within walking distance of your office, it should come as no surprise when employees cross the street and join the next hot thing.
* Star employees away from the echo chambers spend far less time brooding about how much greener the grass is on the other side, and seem happier in their work.

#### It's not about the money

* Remote work may also end up reducing costs and result in fewer-but-more-productive workers – but this is the icing, not the cake.

#### But saving is always nice

* Make the bean counters see dollar signs where you see greater freedom, more time with family, and no commute, and you'll both get what you want.
* Remote work helps the company's bottom line, adds to your own pocket book, and saves the planet via reduced commuting.

#### Not all or nothing

* Remote work is about setting your team free to the best they can be, wherever they might be.
* But nothing precludes you from having an office or all living in the same city.

#### Still a trade-off

* Remote work has drawbacks: Not seeing your coworkers in person, losing imposed structure and regimen, and difficulty in setting boundaries.
* Focus on reaping the great benefits of remote work and mitigating the drawbacks.

#### You're probably already doing it

* Legal, accounting, payroll, and advertising may already be done outside your company's walls, and outside your management's direct control.
* Every day this kind of remote work works, and no one considers it risky, reckless, or irresponsible.
