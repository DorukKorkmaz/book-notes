## Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End

by Atul Gawande

### 1. The Independent Self

* If you cannot use the toilet, eat, dress, bathe, groom, get out of bed, get out of a chair, and walk without assistance (the eight  "Activities of Daily Living") then you lack the capacity for basic physical independence.
* If you cannot shop for yourself, prepare your own food, maintain your housekeeping, do your laundry, manage your medications, make phone calls, travel on your own, and handle your finances (the eight "Independent Activities of Daily Living") then you cannot live safely on your own.
* Old age and infirmity have gone from being a shared, multi-generational responsibility to a mostly private state, experienced alone or with the aid of doctors and institutions.
* Surviving into old age was once uncommon, and those who did served a special purpose as guardians of tradition, knowledge, and history.
* But old age is no longer rare, and technologies of communication – from writing to the Internet – have eroded the value of elders' knowledge and wisdom.
* For young people, the traditional family system has become less a source of security than a struggle for control – over property, finances, and basic decisions about how they could live.
* As children have moved away from their parents, the elderly have not seemed especially sorry to see the children go.
* Whenever the elderly have had the means, they've chosen what social scientists have called "intimacy at a distance."
* Modernization demoted the family, not the elderly. The veneration of elders has not been replaced by the veneration of youth, but by the veneration of independent self.

### 2. Things Fall Apart

* For many chronic illnesses, treatments now stretch the descent of one's health until it looks less like a cliff and more like a hilly road down a mountain.
* But the majority of us live a full life span and die of old age, where one's bodily finally crumbles while medicine performs maintenance measures and patch jobs.
* To maintain the same volume of blood through narrow and stiffened vessels, the blood has to generate increased pressure, leading to half of us develop hypertension by age sixty-five.
* At age thirty, the brain is a 3-point organ that barely fits inside the skull; by our seventies, gray-matter loss leaves almost an inch of spare room.
* By age eight-five, working memory and judgment are so impaired that 40 percent of us have textbook dementia.
* Our life-spans are not programmed into us; only three percent of how long you'll live is explained by your parents longevity.
* Human beings fail randomly and gradually, functioning reliably until a critical component fails, and the whole thing dies in an instant.
* As defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect can impair the whole, resulting in frailty.
* Today we have as many fifty year-olds as five year-olds; in thirty years, there will be as many people over eighty as there are under five.
* While the elderly population grows rapidly, the number of certified geriatricians has actually fallen by 25 percent between 1996 and 2010.
* Each year, about 350,000 Americans fall and break a hip. Of those, 40 percent end up in a nursing home, and 20 percent never walk again.
* A doctor's job is to support qualify of life in two ways: Freedom from the ravages of disease, and retention of enough function for active engagement in the world.
* The body's decline creeps like a vine: Day to day changes are imperceptible, then something happens that makes clear that things are no longer the same.
* Until our last backup system fails, medical care influences whether the path of decay is steep or more gradual, allowing longer preservation of abilities that matter most.
* When the prevailing fantasy is that we can be ageless, the geriatrician demands that we accept that we are not.
* In a year, fewer than 300 doctors will complete geriatrics training – not enough to replace those going into retirement, or to meet demand.
* The risk of a fatal car crash with a driver who's 85 or older is more than three times higher than it is with a teenage driver.
